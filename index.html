              Hi! My name is Henry Lin and I am young professional pursing a career in data science and business
              analytics. I was born in Japan, but raised in Seattle since I was a year old. As a child, grew up speaking
              Japanese. I've always had a passion for the sciences and baseball.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my time at Whitman college while studying mathematics and physics as well a chinese, I also had the
              opportunity to college baseball. Outside of studying and practice, I also volunteered at a local
              elemenatary school and became the marketing directory for our events board.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the past few months, I was an Interpreter/Quality Control Intern for the Seattle Mariners. During my
              time there, I was exposed to the world of analytics and presenting data in a way that is easier to
              interpret.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am interested in pursuing a career in the field of business analytics and would welcome the opportunity
              to bring my analytical background, strong communication skills, and the skills I learned as a Quality
              Control Intern to a postion in Data Science and Business Analytics.
            </P>
